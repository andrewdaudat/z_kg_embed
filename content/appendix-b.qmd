This appendix provides a comprehensive collection of resources, tools, datasets, and libraries for knowledge graph embeddings. The field has seen rapid growth in recent years, resulting in a wealth of resources for both researchers and practitioners. This appendix aims to organize these resources in a structured manner, making it easier for readers to find and utilize the tools they need for their specific knowledge graph embedding tasks.

We begin by listing popular open-source libraries for implementing knowledge graph embedding models, followed by benchmark datasets commonly used for evaluation. We then provide resources for visualizing embeddings, evaluation frameworks, educational resources, and community forums.
